# Reference sequence database of Potential Pathogens
This database was constructed base on the basis of American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) (https://my.absa.org/tiki-index.php?page=Riskgroups) with the species identified as bio-safety level 2 or 3, and then the corresponding reference sequences were downloaded on LPSN - List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (https://www.bacterio.net/) and GeneBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
